I teamed up with interns from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google interns to teach 40 girls and allies C# (http://codecadets.wixsite.com/ home). What made the camp unique was besides being the only free coding camp for middle schoolers in the area, we introduced the students to full time engineers and PMs who are thriving in tech via the Q&As so they can see that they could grow up to succeed too.
