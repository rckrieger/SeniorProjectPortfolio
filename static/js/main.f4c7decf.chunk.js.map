Microsoft internship I noticed the area had many free high school camps but very few middle school ones, and being a tech hub the city had an abundance of interns who could code. So I thought why not give the interns the opportunity to teach and the girls the opportunity to learn to code this summer? I teamed up with interns from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google interns to teach 40 girls and allies C# (http://codecadets.wixsite.com/ home). What made the camp unique was besides being the only free coding camp for middle schoolers in the area, we introduced the students to full time engineers and PMs who are thriving in tech via the Q&As so they can see that they could grow up to succeed too. \",\n    problemSpace: \"Tackling the pipeline problem early on: CS for middle school girls\",\n    criteriaForSuccess:[\"Students learn about potential career paths in CS \",\n        \"Students associate computer science with less stereotypically male terms\",\n        \"Students believe anyone can do computer science\",\n        \"Students can see themselves in the CS field when they grow up\",\n        \"Students learn about the local computer science scene\",\n        \"Students think of computer science positively\",\n        \"Students meet women in tech who they can see themselves in\",\n        \"Community responds positively to the addition of the camp\",\n        \"Teachers get practice explaining complex concepts in simple terms\",\n        \"Teachers feel valued\"\n    ],\n    impact: \"Before the camp started I surveyed students about their skills, experiences, and perceptions of computer science.\" +\n    \" Tellingly, when asked \\\"What are 3 words you think of when you think of computer science?\\\", answers included \"+\n    \"\\\"geeks, boys, nerds\\\" and \\\"difficult strategetic sciencey\\\". Fortunately, when we informally surved them \" +\n      \"at the last camp session, most said it was more fun than they expected. Students also metioned their favorite part\" +\n      \" was meeting local women in tech they could look up to. Although some had parents in engineering, many of the girls reported\" +\n      \" not knowing anyone who looked like them succeeding in the industry before the camp began.

We found the guest speakers just as effective \" +\n      \"and I'd recommend that component to other people planning summer camps.\" +\n      \"\\nThe biggest ethical dilemma I ran into this summer was with IEEE. IEEE said members have been complaing for a while that\" +\n      \"they wanted IEEE to host a summer camp for their kids, so IEEE wanted to fund us. Their stipulation was it couldn't be an all girls camp\" +\n      \" because they were worried about Title IX funding laws. Although we eventually let in brothers of the students to make it easier on parents, we speffically wanted\" +\n      \" to create a community where young women felt safe to try and fail, so I turned their offer down. One piece of feedback I got was the website \" +\n      \"scared off some of the brothers who though the camp would be too \\\"girly\\\". So If I were in the same position again I'd accept the IEEE funnding but make the website \" +\n      \"super girl-y to intimate boys from signing up.\" +\n      \" \\nThe Pacific Science Center offered to host us the next year and it would have made planning much easier.\" +\n      \"The first day of the camp the school had not approved us so my Microsoft mentor convinced his skip-level manager to let us\" +\n      \"us a conference room to hold the first camp session. \" +\n      \"The second camp session the school district forgot to send the custodian to unlock the building, so the teachers taught the students outdoors. Having a decidiated partner to host us would have been much simpler. \" +\n      \"Also the other teachers and I had to transport the laptops Microsoft loaned us each week, which was hassle. If I ran the camp again I'd pick a location which could safely store\" +\n      \"several dozen laptops in a secure location.\" +\n      \"\\nThe most emotionally trying part of the summer was seeing the students struggle. One student who came from an especially rough background tried running away the second to last lesson.

She bolted out of the classroom in frustration and the \" +\n      \"2 teachers had to chase her down while I was tasked with keeping the rest of the students calm and non-reactive.
