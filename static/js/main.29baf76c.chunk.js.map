Having a decidiated partner to host us would have been much simpler. \" +\n      \"Also the other teachers and I had to transport the laptops Microsoft loaned us each week, which was hassle. If I ran the camp again I'd pick a location which could safely store\" +\n      \"several dozen laptops in a secure location.\" +\n      \"\\nThe most emotionally trying part of the summer was seeing the students struggle.
